### Frontend: React.js

1. **Project Setup:**
    - Use `create-react-app` to initialize the React project.
    - Ensure the project is structured with separate folders for components, services, and styles.

2. **Component Structure:**
    - **Image Component:** Display the static image as shown on the left side of the screen.
    - **Form Component:** Create a form to capture user inputs on the right side. This form should include fields like Country, Bank Key, Bank Account Number, Reference, etc.
    - **Invoice Details Component:** Display invoice details such as currency, amount, etc.
    - **Action History Component:** Track and display the history of actions performed.

3. **Class-Based Components:**
    - Implement all components using React class-based components.
    - Use `componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `componentWillUnmount` lifecycle methods to manage API calls and component state.

4. **State Management:**
    - Use component state to manage form inputs and data.
    - Implement methods to handle form submission, validation, and resetting the form.

5. **API Integration:**
    - Use Axios or Fetch API to interact with the backend.
    - Create service files to handle API calls for fetching and submitting data.

6. **Styling:**
    - Use CSS or a CSS-in-JS library like styled-components to style the components according to the provided design.
